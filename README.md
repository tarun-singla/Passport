This project is based on classification. Decision tree algorithm is implemented.

This project is used to identify potentially fake passports from original ones.
The model is trained on properties of images like correlation of photo with
person's photo, contrast, energy and inverse difference moment.

An accuracy of ~0.97 is obtained.
